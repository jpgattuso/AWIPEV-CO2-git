# **Introduction**

- CO<sub>2</sub> is an acid gas (it produces a weak acid when combined with water)
- Each of us adds 4 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per day to the ocean (increasing acidity, reducing pH)
- Arctic surface water will become corrosive for aragonite: 50% in 2050, 100% in 2100
- Critical to document the changes but no high frequency time-series

# **Instruments installed** 

- Water pumped from 12 m water depth at Ny-Ålesund
- **July 2015**: Two pCO<sub>2</sub> sensors rotating every year (in FerryBox, 1 min) 
- **February 2016**: Total alkalinity analyser (in FerryBox, 90 min) but lots of technical issues
- For calibration and quality insurance: weekly discrete samples for high-precision measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity
- **August 2017**: pH measurements
  - Continuous measurements in fjord water (seaFET)
  - DURAFET pH sensor in the FerryBox
  - Discrete pH samples once a month for calibration
- Regular maintenance twice a year (except during the Covid-19 pandemic)
- Came to an end in December 2021

## **Availability of data**
Many challenges:

- extreme environmental conditions
- frozen pipes
- damages resulting from icebergs pounding on the field instruments
- weeks to months waiting for warmer temperatures to deice or to fly technical staff, including divers
- No access for extended periods of time during the Covid-19 pandemic

Nevertheless:
- data usable 50 to 76% of the time during the period of measurement
- pCO<sub>2</sub> and pH data are available throughout the year and well distributed across months, including winter months

# **Conclusion**

- **First** high-frequency time series of the carbonate system in the Arctic 
- **Positive aspects**: 
  - Excellent support from AWIPEV staff but work overload
  - IPEV support secured for another 4-year period (2019-2022)
- **Logistical difficulties**:
  - Challenging environment; divers needed to sort out issues
  - Difficult and costly to gather a team and organize field trip at short notice
  - Winter sampling essential (once a month this season, more frequently would be more desirable)
  - Demanding for AWIPEV staff
  - IPEV does not cover the cost of analyses required for calibration (ca. 1000 €)
