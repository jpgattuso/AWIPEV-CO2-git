# **Introduction**

- Arctic region:  one of the "**reasons for concern**" of the IPCC.
- Arctic Ocean: less than 1% of ocean water but receives 11% of the global runoff; 7-10% of the global burial of organic carbon
- **SST** increased twice as fast as other regions; projections of up to +5.5 °C in 2100 
- Projected decrease in surface **pH** by 2100 larger than elsewhere (-0.45 vs -0.06 to -0.32 units)
- **Undersaturation** of surface water with respect to aragonite ﬁrst reported in 2008 in the Canada Basin; due to the decrease of salinity and degradation of organic matter
- **No** fewer observations than elsewhere for carbonate variables: 11.6% of the SOCAT pCO<sub>2</sub> records and 9.1% of the GLODAP C<sub>T</sub> records are from the Arctic Ocean which is only about 4.3% of the global ocean surface
<!-- - Coastal data relatively well represented in both products (25% and 10% of the SOCAT and SOCAT Arctic data, respectively) -->
- **Uneven distribution**: 71.5% of the SOCAT pCO<sub>2</sub> data and 72% of the GLODAP C<sub>T</sub> data collected Jun-Sep). Few to very few data Dec-Mar.
- Critical to document the changes but no high frequency multi-year time-series

# **Instrumental set-up** 

- Water pumped at **11 m depth**
- **July 2015**: Two pCO<sub>2</sub> sensors rotating every year (in FerryBox, 1 min) 
- **February 2016**: Total alkalinity analyser (in FerryBox, 90 min) but lots of technical issues
- For calibration and quality insurance: weekly discrete samples for C<sub>T</sub> and A<sub>T</sub>
- **August 2017**: pH measurements
  - Continuous measurements in fjord water (seaFET)
  - DURAFET pH sensor in the FerryBox
  - Discrete pH samples once a month for calibration
- Regular maintenance twice a year (except during Covid-19 pandemic)
- Came to an end in December 2021

# **Availability of data**
:::: {style="display: flex;"}
::: {class='col-md-4'}
Many challenges:

- extreme environmental conditions
- frozen pipes
- damages resulting from icebergs pounding on the field instruments
- weeks to months waiting for warmer temperatures to deice or to fly technical staff, including divers
- No access for extended periods of time during the Covid-19 pandemic

Nevertheless:

- data usable 50 to 76% of the time during the period of measurement
- pCO<sub>2</sub> and pH data are available throughout the year and well distributed across months, including winter months

# **Nutrients**
:::: {style="display: flex;"}
::: {class='col-md-4'}

- 90 phosphate and 133 silicate data kindly provided by van de Poll (unpubl.)
- PO4 and Si vary by a factor 10 along a composite year
- disregarding nutrients does not generate large differences:
  - pCO2-AT pair, differences in pH, CT and OmegaA: < 0.001 unit, 0.7 umol/kg and <0.01
  - CT-AT pair: differences in pH, pCO2 and OmegaA: 0.002 units, 1.5 uatm and <0.01

# **K1 and K2**

- Big issue in the Arctic due to low temperature and salinity (Sulpis et al., 2020) 
- Lueker et al. (2000), which are recommended by the community (Jiang et al., 2022) derived in lab conditions with no temperature value < 2 °C. Overestimates K1 and K2 at temperatures below about 8 °C
- Millero et al. (2002) and Sulpis et al. (2020) based on large (> 900) field data sets that include cold temperature values
- Papadimitriou et al. (2018), obtained in the laboratory, also cover cold temperatures
- Formulations of Papadimitriou et al. (2018) perform better here but seldom used
- Hence, we used the facto standard of Lueker et al. (2000)

# **Water column stratification**

:::: {style="display: flex;"}
::: {class='col-md-5'}

- Weird profiling approach
- Salinity in the bottom layer (8 to 12 m) is up to 1 unit higher than in the surface layer (0 to 4 m) in summer, 0.7 unit lower in Dec and similar in both layers at other times
- Temperature is lower by up to 2.7°C in the deep layer from Mar to Sep and higher by up to 2.4 °C in Nov-Jan
- Density is almost always higher in the bottom than in the surface layer.

# **Conclusion**

- **Positive aspects**: 
  - **First** multi-year, high-frequency time series of the carbonate system in the Arctic 
  - Excellent support from AWIPEV staff until 2020
- **Logistical difficulties**:
  - Winter sampling essential
  - Challenging environment; divers needed to sort out issues
  - Difficult and costly to gather a team and organize field trip at short notice
  - New regulation for using HgCl<sub>2</sub> and transporting poisoned samples
